# DB25 Homework 7: Append-Only Key-Value Store

This project is a simple append-only key-value store implemented for the Databases course (Spring 2025).  
It supports `SET` and `DELETE` operations, logs all changes to a file, and reconstructs state on startup by replaying the log.

## ✅ Features

- `SET key value`: Stores a value under a key.
- `DELETE key`: Removes the key.
- Persistent storage via append-only `data.log`
- Rebuilds current state by replaying the log file.

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the CLI

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example

```text
> SET name Alain
> SET language Python
> DELETE name
> EXIT
```

### Final state in memory:

```json
{
  "language": "Python"
}
```

## 🛠 Internals

- All operations are logged to `data.log`.
- On startup, the log is replayed to reconstruct the current in-memory dictionary.

```

This project is inspired by the concept of **log-structured storage**, covered in Lecture 8 of the DB25 course.
